        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 boneless pork chops (and a meat mallet)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Flour for dusting</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten, for breading</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>
                ½  cup dashi stock (you can use chicken or vegetable stock if 
                you can’t get a hold of some dashi or dashi powder)
            </li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
            <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1 small onion, sliced thin</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup peas (alternatively, you can top it with scallions/green 
                onions, thinly sliced nori, sesame seeds, whole snowpeas, and 
                any combination of any of these)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Begin heating up some oil in a deep pan on the stove.  About ½” 
                of oil should do.  Alternatively, if you have a deep fryer and 
                feel comfortable using it, go ahead a use that for the pork 
                katsu.
            </li>
            <li>Use a meat mallet to pound the pork to about ¼” thick.</li>
            <li>
                Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust them with 
                the flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip the pork into the first beaten egg, then coat them with 
                panko crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the oil is hot (get some water on your hand and flick it 
                into the oil from a safe distance above, if it sizzles and pops, 
                the oil is ready), place the breaded pork into the oil.  Fry 
                them until golden brown on each side.  Once they’re cooked, 
                remove them from the oil, and set them aside on a plate with 
                some paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you haven’t already made your rice, start cooking it now, 
                using   this recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the stock, soy sauce, mirin and sugar to a pan (one big 
                enough to hold both pork chops) and bring it to a simmer.  Add 
                in the onions and cover the pan with a lid.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the onions are translucent, slice the pork katsu, and 
                carefully (as to keep the slices together, treating them as if 
                it were still a whole cutlet) add it on top of the onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat the remaining two eggs and pour them on top of the pork 
                katsu.  Cover the pan with the lid.
            </li>
            <li>Begin portioning the rice into two bowls.</li>
            <li>
                Once the eggs are done (still kind of jiggly and slimy looking, 
                but definitely not liquid anymore.  If you’re squeamish about 
                eggs, feel free to cook it a bit longer, but be careful not to 
                allow the egg to become dry and fluffy), pick up the pan and 
                slide/pour the sauce, onions, katsu, and egg onto the rice in 
                the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Top with peas or your choice of garnish.</li>
            <li>
                Reward yourself with this delicious meal. (But only after you 
                win the skating competition, of course.)
            </li>

            <li>2 tbsp. oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, sliced thin</li>

            <li>½   pound beef chuck roast, cubed, or stew meat</li>
            <li>
                ¼   cup red wine (substitute 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/8

            <li>1 medium pre-cooked yukon gold potato</li>

            <li>⅓   cup peas (optional)</li>
            <li>Half of a bar of dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, we’re going to start with the roux. Melt the butter over 
                medium low heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the flour and whisk the butter and flour together in the 
                pan until the mixture turns a golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the garam masala and black pepper and stir to combine, then 
                add the tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce and combine. 
                Continue to cook until it becomes thick and paste-like. Remove 
                from heat and set aside until the meat and veggies are ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine yeast, water, and sugar in a bowl. Let it sit for 
                5-10 minutes, until foamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the rest of the dough ingredients and knead for 8-10 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover with a dish towel and allow dough to rise in a warm place 
                until doubled in size, about 1 to 1½   hours.  If it’s cool in 
                the kitchen, I frequently turn on a stove top burner, and let 
                the dough sit on the counter near it to help the rising process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Let rest for 10 minutes 
                (make sure not to let them dry out, cover them with a damp paper 
                towel or two).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your pan.  Pat the beef down with a 
                paper towel to remove any excess moisture, sprinkle some salt 
                and pepper on the meat, and dust with a bit of flour.  Once the 
                pan is hot, add your meat, cooking for about 6-7 minutes on each 
                side, or until nice and brown.  Then, put the meat into a bowl 
                and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a pan, and saute onion and garlic.  While sauteing, 
                grind the cardamom and anise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the browned beef, wine, water, carrots, potatoes, salt, 
                apple puree, cardamom, anise, and bay leaf, and then bring to a 
                boil over high heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer partially covered 
                until the carrots are tender (about 45 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add in the curry roux that you set aside in step 3 and the 
                chocolate, and stir until the roux and liquid in the pan combine 
                and thicken into a nice curry sauce.  Set aside to cool, and 
                don’t forget to remove the bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dust your hands with flour!  Flatten the dough balls into a 
                round disc, place a spoonful of filling in the middle, and wrap 
                wrap the edges around the filling. Gently shape each dough ball 
                into a bun.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a frying pan, heat about an inch of oil (vegetable, canola, 
                or sunflower oil are preferred). Add the buns, however many will 
                fit in your pan at a time. Fry them on medium/low until golden 
                brown, turning over to cook each side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them cool, then present to the judges.  Or your friends.  
                Or just eat them yourself.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
            <li>
                About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a 
                box, the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)
            </li>
            <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
            <li>1 Green Onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Optional</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Aburage - that's those brown sticks on the right side of the 
                bowl, it's a type of soy product that's used when you make 
                inari-zushi.  It's some of my favorite stuff, and you should be 
                able to find it at an Asian food store.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nori - I forgot to put this is mine, but it's those black/green 
                sheets sticking out of the back.  You'd probably be able to find 
                this at any grocery store with an Asian foods section
            </li>
            <li>
                Kamaboko - This is that white thing with the pink swirl.  Its 
                made of a sort of fish paste that is steamed into like a cake.  
                I know it's kind of distintive in the Naruto ramen, but I didn't 
                have time to go and grab some from an Asian food store (which is 
                where you'd have to get it).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just 
                soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want.  
                Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 
                minutes, or until cooked all the way through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring 
                to a boil and cover with a lid.  It should take about 10 minutes 
                to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a 
                bowl of cold water to cool.

                While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot 
                and bring it to a simmer.  You can add soy sauce or mirin to 
                taste.

                Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the 
                flavor packets.  Let that cook.

                Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them 
                in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green 
                onion into thin slices.

                Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place 
                all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small 
                rectangles of nori.  Itadakimasu!
