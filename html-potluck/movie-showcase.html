        <p>
            The film follows two young sisters, <b>Satsuki</b> and <b>Mei</b>, 
            who move with their father to a house in <br> the countryside so 
            they can be closer to their mother, who’s recovering in a nearby 
            hospital. <br> While exploring their new home and its surroundings, 
            the girls discover that the nearby forest is <br> inhabited by 
            magical creatures — the most special one being a large, gentle 
            forest spirit named <br> Totoro.
            <br><br>
            Totoro and his friends (including the Catbus, a giant cat-shaped 
            bus) bring wonder, comfort, and <br> magic into the sisters’ lives, 
            especially during moments of worry about their mother’s health. <br>
            Through these experiences, Satsuki and Mei learn about patience,
            hope, and the beauty of <br> the world around them.

            <b>Perfect Blue (1997)</b> is a psychological thriller directed by 
            Satoshi Kon. It follows Mima Kirigoe, <br> a young pop idol who 
            quits her music career to become an actress. As she tries to take on 
            more <br> mature roles and redefine her image, Mima begins to lose 
            her sense of identity.
            <br><br>
            An obsessive fan stalks her, a website starts documenting her life 
            in disturbing detail, and she <br> begins to see visions of her old 
            “idol self” accusing her of betrayal. The line between <br>
            <b>reality and illusion</b> 
            blurs as Mima questions what’s real, who’s watching her, and who she 
            truly is.
            <br><br>
            The film explores the psychological pressure of fame, the loss of 
            privacy in media culture, and the <br> fragility of identity — 
            making it one of the most influential animated thrillers ever made.

            <b>Corpse Bride (2005)</b> is a gothic stop-motion animated film 
            directed by Tim Burton and <br> Mike Johnson.
            <br><br>
            It tells the story of Victor Van Dort, a shy young man who is 
            nervous about his arranged marriage <br> to Victoria Everglot. While 
            practicing his wedding vows alone in the woods, Victor accidentally 
            <br> places the ring on what he thinks is a branch — but it turns 
            out to be the finger of Emily, a deceased <br> bride who rises from 
            the grave believing they are now married.
            <br><br>
            Victor is dragged into the Land of the Dead, a colorful and lively 
            world compared to the dull and <br> repressive world of the living. 
            As he tries to find his way back, he learns Emily’s tragic story and 
            <br> becomes torn between his duty to Victoria and his compassion 
            for Emily.
            <br><br>
            The film explores themes of love, loss, and letting go, showing 
            that true love is selfless — even <br> beyond death.
