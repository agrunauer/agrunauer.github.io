                <h3>Miyazaki on AI Animation</h3>
                <p>
                    Miyazaki has long been publicly against AI creativity in the 
                    past. One of the most famous instances was in 2016 when 
                    Dwango AI Lab researchers introduced him to an AI-generated 
                    animation project.
                    The presentation was in the form of a robotically walking, 
                    AI-generated monster, in order to demonstrate the ability of 
                    machine learning to be used in animation. Miyazaki’s 
                    reaction was anything but impressed. He called the 
                    demonstration “an insult to life itself,” expressing deep 
                    discomfort at the idea of removing human intention and 
                    emotion from animation. His reaction was widely popular 
                    online. Given this history, it is unsurprising that 
                    AI-generated Ghibli art has sparked fresh discussions among 
                    fans and industry professionals.
