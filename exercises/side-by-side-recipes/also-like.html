                        Packed with flavor, this is not your momma’s chicken pot 
                        pie. It’s creamy, herby, and loaded with tender chicken 
                        and veggies, all tucked under buttery puff pastry 
                        squares that bake up golden and crisp. Perfect for the 
                        colder nights coming up, it’s cozy, comforting, and the 
                        kind of dinner you’ll want on repeat all season long.
