        <h1>No Face Course</h1>
        <p>
            You're driving along with your partner and sibling to an old friend
            of yours house'. He lives very deep in the woods, so on your way
            there the road separates giving you two paths to take. 
        <br>
            One is a 10 minute drive to your friend's house, but the poster is 
            written in blood and a death sign, and the other is a 3 hour drive, 
            but it written in normal letters. Which path do you take? 
        </p>
        
        <br>
