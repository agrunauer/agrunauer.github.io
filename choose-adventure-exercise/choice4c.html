        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You decided to return from where you came from, but it is too late 
            now. No Face found all of you, and it's going after you to steal 
            your face.
        <br>
            You're on your own now. This game can't help you any longer. I hope
            you find your way out of that place and survive the "No Face Curse"
            Just Remember, don't look at the void in its face!
        </p>
