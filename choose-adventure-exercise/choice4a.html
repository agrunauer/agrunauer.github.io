        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You stop the car, turn it off, and hide inside it. A few minutes
            later you look through the view mirror and the figured is not there
            anymore. It disappeared, so you keep driving to your destiny. 
        <br>
            You see your friend's house from afar. You made it safe there!
            Enjoy your visit!
        </p>
