        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You kept driving and the figure made you look at it. You see the 
            void in its head, making you lose control of the steer wheel, 
            causing a car accident.
        <br>
            You wake up hospitalized, and the doctors tell you your family
            didn't make it out alive. For you to be able to survive they had 
            to make you a face replacement. 
        <br>
            You're confused and notice your entired head bandaged. You take it 
            off finding your family's members face parts untouched in the 
            accident to your face. Now you're not yourself anymore, but you
            survived!
        </p>
